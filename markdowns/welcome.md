# VueJS Basics!

Vue.js is quite famous front end library in nowadays. So It is worth to take a look at it. It is simple, minimal core with an incrementally adoptable stack that can handle apps of any scale. Vue (pronounced /vjuÀê/, of view) is a progressive framework for building user interfaces. The core library is focused on the view layer only and is very easy to pick up and integrate with other libraries or existing projects. On the other hand, Vue is also perfectly capable of powering sophisticated Single-Page Applications.
